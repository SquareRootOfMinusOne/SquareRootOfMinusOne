A bit about me...

I have a background equally grounded in code, design and law -- and my current interests are split between three main areas (with a little cross-over):

  1) The computational modelling of legal theory and the law.
  2) The incorporation of ML derived models into the 3D graphics rendering pipeline.
  3) Reducing complex data into informative visualisations.

While I have professional experience in using 3D graphics to build and render data-driven models, I've always treated the renderer as a bit of a black-box. To this end, I'm currently learning OpenGL, GLSL, Nvidia's Material Definition Language (MDL), Pixar's Universal Scene Description (USD) and Slang as well as building a physical renderer in C++. Once I feel relatively comfortable with how virtual light bounces around matrices, I'll move on to Vulkan and SPIR-V and develop a better understanding of parallel programming.

I'm reasonably proficient in Python, SQL and Prolog, but can deal with C++ if absolutely nesessary (and am working to improve!) I'm familiar with PyTorch, and a little Tensorflow -- but I understand the underlying maths far better than I understand either of these frameworks (which isn't necessarily a lot!). I'm currently interested in Logical and Graph Neural Networks (LNNs & GNNs) and and how they might bridge the chasm between symobolic logic (particularly non-monotonic logic) and statistically driven inference. 

I enjoy poker, retro video games and listening to drum and bass.

I'd love to work with others, so if you have similar interests or feel like you have something to teach me I'd be delighted to hear from you. I have an awful lot to learn.
